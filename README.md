# Mitigating-Cross-Site-Request-Forgery-Threats-on-the-Web

Developed a web extension that uses a combination of features extracted from web pages, such as URL structure, content analysis, and historical data. These features are then fed into a random forest machine-learning model for classification. If the model predicts that a link is malicious, a pop-up warning is displayed to the user. Technologies used were HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Machine Learning, and browser-specific extension APIs (Chrome's Extension API).
